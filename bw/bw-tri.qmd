Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

ggplot(elections, aes(x = percent_hispanic, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(
    title = "2020 Election Winner by Percent Hispanic",
    subtitle = "Counties in Alabama",  
    x = "Percent Hispanic",
    y = "Count of Counties",
    fill = "2020 Winner",
    caption = "Source: mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dem" = "lightblue", "repub" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
