Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = winner_20)) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical) +
  labs(
    title = "Election Winners by Historical Context in 2020",
    subtitle = "Election Winners in Different Historical Classifications",
    x = "Winner in 2020",
    y = "Counties count",
    fill = "Winner",
    caption = "Source: mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv" 
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dem" = "lightblue", "repub" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
