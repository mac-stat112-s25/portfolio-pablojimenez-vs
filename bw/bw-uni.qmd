Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) + 
  labs(
    title = "High Peaks' Elevation",
    caption = "Source: mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv",
    subtitle = "Adirondack Mountains",
    x = "Elevation (feet)", 
    y = "Number of Hikes",
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),           
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),            
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0) 
  )
