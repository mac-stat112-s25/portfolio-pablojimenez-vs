---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = per_capita_income, y = median_rent)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = historical), alpha = 0.7) +  
  labs(
    title = "Per Capita Income agains Median Rent",
    subtitle = "In Alabama Counties",
    x = "Per Capita Income",
    y = "Median Rent",
    color = "Historical Context",
    caption = "Source: mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightblue", "purple", "red")) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
